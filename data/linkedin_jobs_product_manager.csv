Description

AWS External Security Services (ESS) is redefining how enterprises are defending their cloud-based applications and services. We are innovating in cloud security with services like Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Detective, and AWS Security Hub. Our team is growing and we need an experienced senior product manager to help lead the product vision for Amazon Detective, one of our most innovative security services focused on security investigation and response.

As principal product manager for Amazon Detective you will lead the product vision for a key set of features, such as expanded coverage, user experience, and cross service integration. As part of this, you will lead feature definition, prioritization, and partner coordination. We are looking for an experienced product leader who is passionate about solving customer problems and who has demonstrated success working backwards from ambiguous customer needs, translating them into disruptive, successful products that delight customers.

In this role, you will define, execute, and deliver a product roadmap for our customers. You will work closely with dozens of internal AWS services and external partners to integrate their products with Detective. This role is inherently cross-functional -- you will work closely with engineering, design, partner, and executive teams to bring a consumer product to the market and develop and grow a new business opportunity for Amazon. A successful candidate will be highly analytical and organized, able to work effectively in a start-up like environment, and adept at synthesizing a variety of technologies and capabilities into high quality products and applications that customers love.

Working closely with teams across AWS, you’ll see and feel the impact of your work on our customers. This is a high visibility and high impact role that will interact with all levels of AWS leadership. Our ideal candidate is excited about the incredible opportunity cloud computing represents and is deeply passionate about delivering the highest quality services. You’re naturally customer-centric and thrive in a fast-paced environment that requires strong technical and business judgment and solid communication skills.
